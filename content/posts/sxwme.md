## 歌词

Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me all and fulfill my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me all and fulfill my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
I said my lady
Say yeah
Say ooooh yes
Yes yes

Sexiest thing I ever seen
No filter thighs smoking like nicotine
Tryna stretch you out like a limousine
Sex on fire, spread the lotion like kerosene
Yea you I know I stay with it, wet up like bidet wit it
Ya body is my playground, time to 4play with it
Kill it get away with it, first 48
She relate no escape, build a case still stay in it

Lady take off
High sex drive got ya boy speeding with the brakes off
Burn that cake off
Turn that thang raw
You my main line give u FaceTime bout to break it down with my cape off
Bout to Pass it to the homie like she down w Nate Dogg
Blowing up the hood that lil mama napalm
Got me callin in the morning til the til the break a dawn
Lil sip of henny and it's on

Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me all and fulfill my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me all and fulfill my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?

Look... I'll love you harder than a rock girl
The moon shining like the diamonds on my watch girl
I love your bottom so let's take it from the top girl
Red light district but don't let that stop you
There ain't nothin wrong with a lil' bump and grind
Yeah we be up all night fuckin' til' the sun come up
Girl lemme break yo walls like I was the juggernaut
Yeah it's the renaissance what I do is a work of art
Let's get lit off the champagne
Turn off yo phone who cares what yo man's sayin'
Get nasty like the old LL
We'll be doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Play with it lemme watchya
Notorious when I'm in the sauce
I gotta gun between my legs bout to shoot up yo place
Cause I love it when you call me Big Poppa

Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me all and fulfill my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me all and fulfill my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Now can i get nasty baby?
I wanna spread your legs open wide
And lick you up
And lick you down
I said lick you up
And lick you down
Now I'm gonna turn your body over
Make you scream over and over, yeah...
I can give it to you
I can give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you baby…
Baby, you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me all and fulfill my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me all and fulfill my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
