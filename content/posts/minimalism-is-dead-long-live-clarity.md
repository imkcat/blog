For a decade, we removed buttons. We hid chrome. We made everything a gesture. And users got lost.

True clarity doesn't come from absence; it comes from obviousness. The new wave of design embraces density, provided it is structured. We can have 50 controls on a screen if the visual hierarchy guides the eye effortlessly.

Glassmorphism allows this density. By blurring the background, we create a dedicated workspace that feels light, despite holding complex data.
