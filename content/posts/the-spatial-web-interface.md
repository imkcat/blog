The interface of the future is not flat. It is not confined to a single plane of glass in your pocket. It is spatial, immersive, and fluid.

As we move towards iOS 26 and beyond, the boundaries between the digital and physical dissolve. We are seeing a shift towards "materials" rather than colors. Glass, acrylic, light—these are the building blocks of the modern UI.

### The Role of Depth

Depth is no longer just a visual trick; it is an organizational principle. Z-index is the new hierarchy. When an element floats closer to you, it demands attention not just because it's bigger, but because it exists in a different layer of reality.

### Motion as Meaning

Animation is not delight; it is context. The way a window opens tells you where it came from and where it will go. Fluidity is the baseline expectation. Jitter is a bug in reality.
