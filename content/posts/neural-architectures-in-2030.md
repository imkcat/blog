It started with simple prompts. Then came context windows. Now, we have reasoning budgets. The concept of "Thinking" in AI models introduced in the mid-2020s was the pivotal moment.

Giving the model permission to pause, reflect, and iterate internally before outputting a token changed everything. It wasn't just about accuracy; it was about nuance.

Today's neural architectures are recursive. They build their own tools. The engineer's role has shifted from writing syntax to curating intent.
